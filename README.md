# command-script
command script (or cmd script for short) is very simple programming language that runs on the Lua interpreter, the language is similar to minecraft commands. it is currently in Alpha 1.1.2

# whats new in command script 1.1.2:
1. replaced 'else if' with 'elseif' so I don't have to use so many ends
2. got rid of 'if's' alltogether by using a table
3. there is a Main loop to run commands

# what does cmd script code look like?
cmd script is run in the terminal at this point in time there are only a few commands:

1. /stop --kills all processes and exits the terminal
2. /rand -- prints out a random number from 0 to 1 
3. /say *insert text here* -- prints out what ever you after '/say '
4. /sleep *insert number here* -- this command will do nothhing for the amount of time (in seconds) you put in
5. /help -- doesn't actually give you any help
