# command-script
command script (or cmd script for short) is very simple programming language that runs on the Lua interpreter, the language is similar to minecraft commands. it is currently in Alpha 1.1.8

# whats new in command script 1.1.8:
1. added /luaver command, it prints the version of lua the user has
2. added /ghublnk command, it prints the github link to this repo 
## List of commands:
0. /ghublnk -- prints github link to this repo
1. /stop -- kills all processes and exits the terminal
3. /rand -- prints out a random number from 0 to 1 
4. /say *insert text here* -- prints out what ever you put after '/say '
5. /sleep *insert number here* -- this command will do nothhing for the amount of time (in seconds) you put in
6. /help -- doesn't actually give you any help, I just put this here because I felt like it
7. /clr -- clears the console
8. /console -- goes back to the Lua console, this command cannot be undone
9. /ver -- displays the version of cmd script you are using
10. /luaver -- prints what version of lua the user has

## math commands
11. /add 
12. /subtract 
13. /div
14. /multiply
-- I don't think I need to explain what these do.

(Note: the math commands are a bit weird, this is something I will fix later or maybe not at all)
