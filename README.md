# command-script
command script is very simple programming language that runs on the Lua interpreter, the language is similar to minecraft commands. it is currently in Alpha 1.1.2

# whats new in command script 1.1.2:
1. replaced 'else if' with 'elseif' so I don't have to use so many ends
2. got rid of '1f's' alltogether by using a table
3. there is a Main loop to run commands

# what does cmd script code look like?
cmd script is run in the terminal at this point in time there are only a few commands:

/stop --kills all processes and exits the terminal
/rand -- prints out a random number from 0 to 1 
/say *insert text here* -- prints out what ever you after '/say '
/sleep *insert number here* -- this command will do nothhing for the amount of time (in seconds) you put in
/help -- doesn't actually give you any help
