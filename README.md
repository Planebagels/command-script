# command-script
command script (or cmd script for short) is very simple programming language that runs on the Lua interpreter, the language is similar to minecraft commands. it is currently in Alpha 1.1.7

# whats new in command script 1.1.7:
1. added /ver command, displays the current version of cmd script

# what does cmd script code look like?
cmd script is run in the terminal, at this point in time there are only a few commands:

##List of commands:
1. /stop --kills all processes and exits the terminal
2. /rand -- prints out a random number from 0 to 1 
3. /say *insert text here* -- prints out what ever you put after '/say '
4. /sleep *insert number here* -- this command will do nothhing for the amount of time (in seconds) you put in
5. /help -- doesn't actually give you any help, I just put this here because I felt like it
6. /clr -- clears the console
7. /console -- goes back to the Lua console, this command cannot be undone
8. /ver -- displays the version of cmd script you are using

## math commands
9. /add 
10. /subtract 
11. /div
12. /multiply
-- I don't think I need to explain what these do.

(Note: the math commands are a bit weird, this is something I will fix later or maybe not at all)
