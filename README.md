# command-script
command script is very simple programming language that runs on the Lua interpreter, the language is similar to minecraft commands. it is currently in Alpha 1.1.2

# whats new in command script 1.1.2:
1. replaced 'else if' with 'elseif' so I don't have to use so many ends
2. got rid of '1f's' alltogether by using a table
3. there is a Main loop to run commands
